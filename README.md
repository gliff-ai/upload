üëã **Welcome in!** üëã

This repository contains the Open Source code for [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai)‚Äôs UPLOAD support library (gliff.ai‚Äôs component for uploading multidimensional images). 

UPLOAD aims to allow users to easily upload a variety of image files, including multidimensional TIFFs, for the purposes of developing imaging AI products. When the full [gliff.ai platform](https://gliff.ai/software/) is used, UPLOAD provides just one step in developing high-quality and auditable datasets that satisfy any relevant regulatory frameworks which enables our users to build world-changing and trustworthy AI models and products.

## Installation

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

Run `npm install @gliff-ai/upload` in your command line to install the package from the npm registry.

## Development

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

Frontend code should always be written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and transpiled using the options in `tsconfig.json` in this repository. npm should always be used for package management.

`npm run serve` will run a local webpack developer server for quick access.

To get started, run `npm i` and `npm run build` from the root directory.

## Linting and Formatting

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

As a standard, all code contributions should be linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) using `.eslintrc.js` and formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). **Note:** HTML + CSS, mark-up and mark-down code are exemptions and should be formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) but do not need to be linted.

`npm run lint` will lint the codebase.

Our GitHub Actions will also lint any pull requests before they're merged.

## Testing

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

All code contributions should be tested using both the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

`npm run test` will run any existing tests in our codebase.

Our GitHub Actions will also test any pull requests before they're merged! These all must pass and have 2 reviewers approval before a pull request can merge. If one or a few fail and your troubleshooting is not giving an answer, please check out the [gliff.ai Contribution Guide](https://github.com/gliff-ai/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) üëã for further guidance.

## Continuous Integration

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

GitHub Actions should only be included under the `.github/workflows` path.

## Examples of Use

Import the `UploadImage` module and the `ImageFileInfo` type:

```javascript
import { UploadImage } from @gliff-ai/upload;
import { ImageFileInfo } from @gliff-ai/upload/typings;
```

Use the `UploadImage` module:

```javascript
setUploadedImage = (
  imageFileInfo: ImageFileInfo,
  slicesData: Array<Array<ImageBitmap>>
): void => {
  this.imageFileInfo = imageFileInfo;
  this.slicesData = slicesData;
};

render = (): ReactNode => (
  <UploadImage
    setUploadedImage={this.setUploadedImage}
    spanElement={
      <Button aria-label="upload-picture" component="span">
        <Backup />
      </Button>
    } // A <span> element that marks the clickable area.
    multiple // allow uploading multiple files at once; use multiple={false} to disallow
  />
);
```

The example above uses [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).
